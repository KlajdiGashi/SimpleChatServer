# Operating Systems Project 02 - Grupi 38 

### General Info 
A [university](https://fiek.uni-pr.edu) team project organized by Operating Systems Subject, the team consists of 3 students.  

### What's the project about?
In this project we will implement a simple Chat Server, where the client and server will communicate with each other 
through Message Passing.
1. First the client connects to the server using server's port  ./client <port>
* After connecting with the server a message will pop up at server's terminal informing us that the client has joined.
2. The communication is done using message passing.
* What is Message Passing? 
  * Message Passing provides a mechanism to allow processes to communicate and to synchronize their actions without sharing the same address space.
  * Message passing provides two operations which are as follows:
    * Send message
    * Receive message
 3. Multiple clients can connect to server and afterwards they can exchange messages with each other.

### Technologies 
The implementation of the program was made using [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) Programming Language and is executed on Ubuntu in a virtual machine.
